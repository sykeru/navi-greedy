1. Under the "<> Code" dropdown, download a ZIP file of this branch.
2. Create a folder named "Navi-Greedy" in your Local Disk (D:).
3. Extract everything from the ZIP file to that folder.
4. Application directory must be exactly "D:/Navi-Greedy/NAvi-Greedy.exe" for the exe file to work.


Thank you!
