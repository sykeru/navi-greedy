1. Under the "<> Code" dropdown, download a ZIP file of this branch
2. Create a folder named "Navi-Greedy" in your Local Disck (D:)
3. Extract everything from the .zip file to that folder 
4. Application directory must be exactly "D:/Navi-Greedy/NAvi-Greedy.exe" for the exe file to work.


Thank you!
